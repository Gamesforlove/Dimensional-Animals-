So all I can do is say congratulations, and thanks, for diving so deep into my game's mechanics and exploring it to the fullest. Finding this message proves you've done it. Thank you so so so so so so much. \n\nI'll also take this opportunity to be one of those cute developers that puts cute messages into their games. I wanna say I hope you're not taking life too seriously and not pushing yourself too hard. This game took over a year to make, and it's a short-ish game with some code from previous games, and it still took long to make. Things take time, but brick by brick the goal is reached.\n\nI don't know how to end this message, so I'll just end it. Thanks again, hope you're doing well and hope you're having fun! - Marcos Game Dev",
